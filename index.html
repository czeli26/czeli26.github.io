        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Crystal, an aspiring software engineer with a passion for AI, 
            problem-solving, and creative technologies. I'm a computer science student at 
            the <a href="https://www.uic.edu/" target="_blank">University of Illinois at Chicago</a>, 
            with plans to graduate in December 2026.
            I am a member of UIC's <a href="https://honors.uic.edu/" target="_blank">Honors College</a>, 
            and a volunteer for UIC's <a href="https://littlesparks.uic.edu/" target="_blank">Little Sparks
                Program</a>, which serves as a resource for parenting students attending UIC.</p>
        <p>When I'm not focusing on school, I love spending time with my family and friends.
            I also have way too many hobbies, including crochet, sewing, pottery painting, or
            really anything that allows me to be creative. I love trying new things and
            getting out of my comfort zone. For most of my life, I would not have considered
            myself a lover of the outdoors, but I moved to Colorado for about a year and a
            half and found a love for mountains and hiking. I also enjoy traveling. Some of
            my most memorable trips were when I hiked the 
            <a href="https://www.highland.gov.uk/greatglenway/" target="_blank">Great Glen Way</a> in 
            Scotland with my grandma, and when I took a solo road trip around the eastern half of the US.

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>I mainly program in C++, but I'm also familiar with C, HTML, and CSS. This semester 
            I am focused on refining my skills in algorithms, data structures, and debugging. I've spent 
            a lot of time deepening my understanding of programming logic. I keep myself 
            busy, usually working on at least two programming projects at a time. My goal is 
            to never stop progressing.</p>
